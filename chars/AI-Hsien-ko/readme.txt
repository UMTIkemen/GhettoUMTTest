Name:  Hsien-Ho (Lei-Lei)
Birthdate : 1730 
Race : Kuang-Shi (Chinese Ghost) 
Birthplace: China 

STORYLINE (as you can read in her intro)
---------
One fateful night in the 1740's, ghosts and spirits of the dead arose from their resting places and attacked a rural Chinese village. The mother of two twin girls, Hsien-Ko and Mei-Ling, gave her life away to defeat the spirits. Luckily, she had taught her daughters the ultimate fighting tactic, "Tensei no Jutsu," before her death. The two girls decided to use a strictly prohibited sub-division of this technique, "Igyo Tenshin no Jutsu," and fight to release their mother's soul from the dark.

An innocent pair of happy twin girls had the same dream on their sweet sixteenth birthday, and the next morning they felt empowered with strange energy. Then, during the fateful next night, the two had a nightmare and subsequently became locked in a state of unconsciousness. Their souls had been transported to a strange dimension which was completely unknown by them, and the twins were unsure as to where they had been taken.
Upon awaking, the first thing they noticed was they were wearing strange, elaborately designed costumes on their bodies. Next, they gradually started to regain the unique power of transformation they had lost during a life preceding this one.
Soon after, the tender two realized that they must combine their forces, in order to return to the normal world and the home where they belong; so they reluctantly agree to advance through the dark. The void is laden with evil souls, and happily engulfs the two innocents. 


KNOWN BUGS
----------
Chuukadan's Time Bomb is intended hittable by both players (only crouching). In Teammode Sometimes hit can be not accurate for your ally. This is caused by mugen limitation.

For A.I. detection I have used the Yongming system (modified by me). That's because I don't like the command method (too slow) or the palette trigger method (It doesn't work well).
In some very rare cases at the start of a round AI takes control of player and keep it for the entire round (if you restart the round, all go OK).
I don't know how to avoid this problem (it's happend rarely and only with keyboard).
Anyway if you use this char only as enemy, it's all OK; otherways you can use the NOAI version.
I'll be very happy when Elecbyte will add a trigger for AI detection.



NOTES:
------
For Comments, Suggestions and Bug Reports mail me at: 
zelgadis296@yahoo.it
-----------------------------------------------------
Important: make sure to have the last DOS/WIN version of MUGEN
because this character doesn't work with versions earlier
than 2001.04.14
-------------------------------------------------------------
The objects are random. 
However, I've found some exceptions:
The first object after a shuriken will be another shuriken or an Akuma statuette.
The second object after a shuriken will always be a dizzying object.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Chuukadan isn't very useful; so to make AI more competitive,
this move doesn't needs power 2 for CPU.
-------------------------------------------------------------
I've made animation also for Demitri's Midnight Bliss. If you want to use,
check air file actions 7795-7796-7797.
Action 7798 is made for Anakharis' Pharaoh Magic.
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't like AI you can use Hsien-koNoAI.cns instead of Hsien-ko.cns
(See also Hsien-ko.def file)
-------------------------------------------------------------
This isn't the only Hsien-ko on the net.
I have taken the others as reference (above all to optimize my alignment),
but I've remade the char from beginning.
Graphic has been ripped with WinKawaks.
Sound has been ripped with Nebula's Jukebox.
All code taken by other chars has been credited.
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you want, you can upload this character on your site,
but don't remove or modify this readme.
Also try to keep this character updated to latest version
(if you mail me I can inform you of new versions).
