C : HK

======== Command Normals ========
-- Collarbone Breaker - F + Mp --
A two hit overhead punch attack.

-- Solar Plexus Strike - F + Hp --
A two hit advancing gut strike. 

On hit it can be cancelled early into any Shoryuken attack.
On hit, it offers great frame advantage to link many normals after.

-- Axe Kick - B + Hk --
A two hit kick that starts off high, then slams down towards the ground.

It will force stand on a crouching opponent.

Causes a knockdown on an airborne opponent.
Both hits can be cancelled into Specials, V-Trigger, and Critical Art.

-- Jodan Nirengeki - St. Hp > Hk --
Two hit target combo that knocks down the opponent.

Final hit can be cancelled into V-Trigger activation, or V-Skill II on hit only.

-- Jodan Sarengeki (Standing) - St. Mp > Hp > Hk --

Medium offers airborne invinicibility from frame 1, and recovers slower.
Heavy offers strike and projectile invincibility from frame 3, does the most damage, and has most recovery frames.

If the light version hits an airborne opponent early, the landing frames can be cancelled into Ex Hadouken or Critical Art.

Ex version grants full invincibility from frame 1, and on a clean grounded hit, will go into a 2nd Shoryuken (Shin Shoryuken)

--- Tatsumaki Senpukyaku <EX> - D, DB, B + Any Kick ---	
Forward travelling hurricane kick.

=========== V-System ============
--- Crush Counters ---
Standing HP -> Soft Knockdown
Standing HK -> Standing Spin
Crouch HK -> Hard Knockdown

--- Mind's Eye ( V-Skill I ) - Mp + Mk ---
A counter/parry attempt that is active from frames 3-10. 

On a successful counter, Ryu can cancel the recovery into another Mind's Eye or Isshin that is active from frames 1-10.
Ryu can also cancel the recovery frames into any Ex Special move or Critical Art.

Ryu gains 50 V-Meter for a successful counter.

During either V-Trigger, a successful counter will add 50 V-Timer.

--- Thrust Strike ( V-Skill II ) - Mp + Mk ---
A forward moving punch sabaki move with a counter box active from frames 10-21F.

If the counter doesn't activate, the attack will knockdown on hit, and be slightly punishable on block.

All level 1 versions will cause a knockdown on hit.

For the charged level 2 version, it will do 2 hits and travel at a faster speed regardless of which version was used to charge it.
For the fully charged level 3 version, it will travel even faster regardless of which version was used to charge it. It will also cause a guard-break at +32F, and hits after will continue at 50% scaling.

The Ex version can be charged up to 2 levels.

Both versions are mostly identical except for the fact that level 2 does slightly more damage and causes the same guard-break on block.

=========== Universal System Mechanics ===========
- Dashing -
Tap Forward twice in repeated succession to perform a forward dash.

Tap Back twice in repeated succession to perform a back dash. Back dashes are throw invincible for the first few frames.

- Quick Rise -
When falling the air during a knockdown input "Down" at the moment of impact to do a quick rise. The word "Technical" will appear if you did it correctly.

- Back Roll -
When falling the air during a knockdown input "Back" at the moment of impact to do a Back Roll. This move recovers 5 frames slower than standard getup. The word "Technical" will appear if you did it correctly.

- Throws -
Press Light Punch and Light Kick simultaneously while standing to perform your throw. 

Your opponent will have 7 frames to also input the same motion. If they do your throw will be teched and you will both be pushed back an equal distance and in a neutral state. Your opponent must be in an idle state (not attacking) in order to tech the throw.

- Power -
The power meter is indicated by 3 blue stocks. Stocks can be spent on Ex moves (1 Stock), or a Critical Art ( 3 stocks ).

- EX Moves -
When you have at least one stock, perform a special move and hit two buttons instead of one to do an EX Attack. The 2 buttons must be the same type (2 punches, or 2 kicks).

- Critical Art -
To perform a Critical Art, you must have all 3 stocks of power meter built. Critical Arts are the only moves capable of chip/cheese KOs.

- Armor -
When you perform a move with armor, you can absorb one attack. 

You will then receive the damage for that attack as recoverable life, which will start building back one second after impact. 

If you are hit at any time before your life is recovered, you will not be able to recover that previously lost life. 

Armored moves will always lose to Critical Arts/Supers/Hypers.

- Reversals -
Reversals are performed by executing a special or critical art at the first possible moment when recovering from a block, hit, or from your wakeup. Reversals moves have no special properties, but the word "Reversal" will appear if you did it correctly.

- Counter Hits -
If you interrupt your opponent out of their attack, you will be rewarded with a counter hit.

Counter hits do 1.2x the damage and will grant 2 Frames of added advantage allowing for more combo potential.

Airborne counter hits do not receive any additional frame advantage, but the 1.2x damage modifier still applies.

- Crush Counters -
If you manage to land counter hit using specifically designated normals, you will be rewarded with a Crush Counter. 

Crush Counters have the same 1.2x damage modifier applied, builds meter, and depending on the move, it will cause a specific type of knockdown or hit animation that can be used to extend combos.

=========== V-System ===========
Unique to SFV is the V-System. The V-System is comprised of either 2 or 3 stocks that build when:

- You take damage
- You use a V-Skill
- You land a Crush Counter

These stocks can be spent on either a V-Reversal ( 1 stock ), V-Shift ( 1 stock ), or V-Trigger ( All Stocks )

--- V-Skill ---
V-Skill is a special move input that is performed by pressing MP + MK. Some are passive and can apply buffs to your character, while others are offensive. Successful usage can build your V-Meter.

--- V-Shift ---
V-Shift is a defensive mechanic performed by pressing HP + MK while in a standing state. It costs 1 stock to perform. You will perform a backdash that is immune to throws. If you are struck with an attack or projectile within the first 9 frames, the game will go into a slow-motion effect until the end of the backdash in which you are completely invincible. You will also receive half of the V-Stock back.

If HP and MK are continously held during the slow-motion effect, your character will then transition into V-Shift Break. The V-Shift Break is an invincible attack that causes no damage, knocks your opponent down if they are hit, and is safe on block at -2.

You cannot perform V-Shift while in V-Trigger.

--- V-Reversal ---
V-Reversal is a defensive mechanic that costs one stock to perform. It must be performed by inputting the correct motion once block stun ends. 

You cannot perform V-Reversals when you are in V-Trigger.

--- V-Trigger ---
V-Trigger is a mechanic that uses up all of your V-Meter and is activated by pressing HP + HK. The activation sequence is very fast and can often be used to extend combos. Should you activate mid-combo, your combo will be scaled by one additional factor.

While the effects vary, many will convert your V-Meter into a V-Timer which unlocks certain specials while the timer is active. Usage of these specials will deplete the timer further a set amount. You cannot V-Reversal, or build V-Meter while the V-Trigger is active.
