====================================
Alex Sin fixing Gohan Z2
====================================

- Added double bounce per combo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- All varsets (var(7)) in all states that require it are now fixed (a.HP / a.HK bounce juggle limit);

JNP, thanks for the tip!
The fixes were added into state 19200 (system.cns) and state 52 (override.cns).

- TargetBind for Diving Kick Flurry added/fixed.

Added image 19897,0 from Piccolo Z2 (image update).




17/10/2016

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New fonts added.
Targetstate instead of p2stateno when possible: I tried to do that for the EX Hurricane Kick, even making two states for it but it doesn't work like it does with the p2stateno, so I left those there.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

01/10/2016

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug reported by Balthazar concerning the Masenko helpers not "exploding" when hitting Super Buu's supermove.
It is now fixed together with little other bugs, like AngleDraw and HitOverride codes.

Changes were made in the .air and helpers.cns files.


Note: I forgot to mention this, but Gohan doesn't use the new damage dampener by PotS; it uses the old one, adapted and customized for his supermoves.

25/09/2016

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Still working on the AI as you've noticed and I think I've gotten at a good point, so here's the update.
- The AI won't guard as much as before.
- He will shoot the Masenko randomly (I hope).

Also some cosmetic changes and adds:
- white screen fade out when doing the Finisher 3;
- sound and graphical fix for some other ground bounce states I overlooked.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



18/09/2016

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1

Changed var(59) with AILevel.

Now the AI should be less aggressive than before.
However it blocks a lot of attacks and I'm trying to figure out how to decrease the cances of it happening without making the AI dumb.

#1 helpers.cns, States 2011, 2021, 2031, 2041

Added ignorehitpause = 1 to all Masenko limiters in the helpers states [ParentVarSet, var(28)].


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 supers.cns, States 2100, 2200

A little oversight has been fixed, regarding the amount of supermoves and Ex moves you can do in Destiny mode.
Ah, the Emotion mode is called Destiny mode for Gohan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 supers.cns, States 2700, 2720

Gekiretsu Ranbu start-up adjusted: now the damage dampener will work as intended.
The reason it couldn't was because a ReversalDef was used: the P2StateNo parameter doesn't allow variables to work properly.

So my way of fixing was to:
- comment the ReversalDef
- add a TargetBind on the first attack of the move. If the attacks don't hit Gohan will go to State 0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4
Added the alternate costume for Gohan (courtesy of Chamat and Ethan The Human).
Also added are the credits in the Thanks section in the Readme. Yes, even though I know very very little about real coding I haven't messed up the ReadMe, so don't worry about that.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 supers.cns, helpers.cns

Reduced damage scaling on Super Hurricane, Chou Kamehameha, Soaring Dragon Strike/Unleashed from combos.
I used var(39) for this.

Now the Masenko helpers will keep the hit count when/after it hits.

As explained in an earlier update, 
if you throw a helper which hits and then you attack the enemy, if the helper goes away before you hit (even if it would be a combo) the hit count goes to 0.

So, in order to keep the combo count, you have to keep the helper in play.


Taken from the Lvl 1 Masenko state (it's the same for the other version, with minimum changes)

[State 2011, End]
type		= ChangeState
trigger1		= pos x!=[-240,240]
value		= 2012

[State 2011, End]
type		= DestroySelf
triggerall	= !MoveContact
trigger1		= pos x!=[-240,240]

if the Masenko doesn't hit, it just flies away and destroy itself;
if the Masenko does    hit, the helper changes to its explosion/vanish state;

in the explosion/vanish state:

[State 2012, End];this allows for the combo counter to not be reset.
type		= DestroySelf
trigger1		= Enemy, MoveType != H

the helper remains until the enemy changes from a/the get hit "move" to another "move".
H means Hit, in other words it defines a get hit type of "move". All get hits, custom states are included.
!= is our "disequal" symbol.

So you read it like this:
if the enemy isn't in any get hit state, the helper disappears. And the combo counter gets reset.

In addition I coded another destroyself:
[State 2012, End]
type		= DestroySelf
trigger1		= Root, winKO

so the helper goes away, when the match is won.


Chou Masenko (spark) coded.
Lvl 1
States:
from 2330 to 2350 (supers.cns)
states 2341, 2351 (helpers.cns)

Number of hits: 13
Smaller, both in CLSNs and effects.


The Chou Masenkos can be used when in Unleashed mode; when it's not activated, you can use the chargeable Masenkos.


Other problems related to these are also fixed, like the Super Background helper calling. (state-2-3.cns)

#1 quick fixes
- Cropped all sprites.
- Changed author name to "Team Z2".
- Changed life to 900.
- The Hurricane Kicks and the Soaring Dragon Kicks all use hitsound 5,5 (strong kick attack).
- Fixed Facebook winpose.
Note: all Z2 characters need to have these codes in state 5150 (usually in the override.cns):

[State 5150, Facebook winpose ChangeAnim]
type		= ChangeAnim
trigger1		= NumEnemy
trigger1		= Enemy, StateNo=181 && Enemy, Time = 411 && Enemy, Name = "Gohan Z2" && Enemy, AuthorName = "Team Z2"
trigger1		= Enemy,var(34) = 1
value		= 18105


[State 5150, Screen doesn't follow the player]
type		= ScreenBound
trigger1		= Enemy, StateNo=181 && Enemy, Name = "Gohan Z2" && Enemy, AuthorName = "Team Z2"
movecamera	= 0,0
value		= 0
ignorehitpause	= 1

[State 5150, 'Portrait' sprite priority]
type		= SprPriority
trigger1		= Anim = 18105
value		= 10
[State 5150, 'Portrait' scale]
type		= AngleDraw
trigger1		= Anim = 18105
scale		= 0.25,0.25
[State 5150, 'Portrait' position]
type		= PosSet
trigger1		= Anim = 18105
X		= IfElse(Facing=-1,-49,-79)
Y		= -ScreenPos Y + 102
persistent	= 0

[State 5150, Facebook winpose SelfState]
type		= SelfState
trigger1		= NumEnemy && PrevStateNo != 5150
trigger1		= Enemy, StateNo = 181 && Enemy, AnimElemTime(6)>500 && Enemy, Name = "Gohan Z2" && Enemy, AuthorName = "Team Z2"
value		= 5150

and in the .air file:

; Gohan Facebook winpose - portrait
[Begin Action 18105]
9000,2, 0,0, 10



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2
Character updated from 04,11,2002 to 1.0.

All pause times are fixed, in all constants files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 system.cns
Dash collision fixed (HDBZ engine updates/tweaks).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 helpers.cns
Fixed the AngleDraw sctrl on "Masenko helper up" (state 2021). If it hits it shall remain fixed at the same angle, ignoring the hit pause.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 state-2-3.cns
No juggle checking after getting dizzied, allowing more combo possibilities.

If you have to code a super which stuns the opponent, remember to add this in state-2-3.cns:


[State -2, Variable 35 set for free juggles]
type		= VarSet
triggerall	= NumEnemy
trigger1		= Enemy, StateNo = 5300
var(35)		= 60

[State -2, Variable 35, subtracting 1 when enemy not in dizzy state]
type		= VarAdd
triggerall	= NumEnemy
trigger1		= (Enemy, StateNo != 5300) && (var(35) > 0)
var(35)		= -1

[State -2, Free juggle when opponent is dizzy]
type		= AssertSpecial
trigger1		= var(35) > 0
flag		= NoJuggleCheck


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#6 supers.cns

Super Hurricane Kick (state 2500)
- Added more sound effects; changed strong kick sounds with medium kick sounds;
- the hits are quicker (edited pausetime of the hitdefs);
- added Vacuum effect for the super move (codes taken from PotS Ryu and adapted for this character).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#7 gohan.air

I think the combo hitcount reset problem with the Masenko is now fixed. I edited anim 2512 to have 12 more ticks.

It's basically a helper problem:
if you throw a helper which hits and then you attack the enemy, if the helper goes away before you hit (even if it would be a combo) the hit count goes to 0.
I read about this somewhere in MFG and it's actually true for some cases.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1 gohan.sff
Re-added sprite group 907 (yellow aura sprites) so they're not shared with group 905 (blue aura sprites).

Bonus: this also fixes the aura problem in the Unleashed mode charge.
The aura is supposed to be yellow during the Unleashed mode.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 .def file
Reverted mugenversion from 1.0 back to WinMugen
mugenversion = 04,11,2002

Bonus: this adjusts the Chou Kamehameha, the Hurricane Kick super and the Soaring Dragon Strike problem... for some unknown reason.

Update:
The reason is explained here: http://mugenguild.com/forum/topics/how-convert-character-winmugen-mugen-1-0-121201.0.html
(pause times in hitdefs)

The next update will have this and other stuff fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 normals.cns (states 620, 650)
Swapped damage of aerial strong punch and strong kick.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 .snd file
Updated sound files in regards to the HDBZ engine updates/tweaks topic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 specials.cns (state 1200)
Added poweradd for the Diving Flurry Kick (he gains power when performing it, even if he doesn't hit).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#6 specials.cns (state 1250)
EX Diving Flurry Kick will not give power back.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#7 normals.cns (state 270), specials.cns
Wing Kick (s.SKx2) hitsound changed from 2604,0 (strong special attack) to 5,6 (strong hit sound) instead of 5,5 (like Balthazar requested) because I think it fits more. I can always change it to 5,5, but then what about the envshake?

Diving Flurry Kick last hit sound changed from 2604,0 (strong special attack) to 5,5 (strong normal kick attack).
EX Diving Flurry Kick last hit sound changed from 2604,0 (strong special attack) to 5,6 (strong hit sound). If needed I can change it to 5,5 (strong normal kick attack).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#8 supers.cns (state 2800), system.cns (state 900), helpers.cns
Emotion system edited so the effects (dust, lightning) don't move when in superpause.

How did I do that? By coding the dust and lightning effects as helpers. (states 908, 909, 2805)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#9 specials.cns (state 1100)

Soaring Dragon Kick second attack (medium version) knocks up the opponent higher to allow another Soaring Dragon Kick.
To do that I added two hitdefs and the air.velocities of the second one changes if var(5)=1 (medium version).

4/07/2016

Problems I noticed:
(these weren't present in the Majin build)
- the standing Chou Kamehameha does 30 hits and doesn't knock the opponent down.
- The Soaring Dragon supermoves don't work like in the Majin build. I thought it was a snap or a targetbind problem but I can't find those codes. There's more, the codes look the exact same as the ones he has in the Majin build!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1 gohan.sff
Edited image 18100,0 to not have the name and pictures, so that the text "Gohan wins" at the end of the match fits.
(I've discussed this with Balthazar)
So that fixes the "Gohan wins" problem.

Note: I left the original image in the .sff, numbered 18100,1. If you don't want it you can delete it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 system.cns, override.cns, state 181

Increasing the time length of the Facebook winpose and the enemy portrait that gets displayed.
Portrait used= 9000,2

Bonus:
fixed ChangeAnim2 bug.
Debug message, if used, would be: "Used ANIM2 outside of custom state", so I changed it to just ChangeAnim.
It might be wrong coding-wise, but it's a winpose and I guess people won't be bothered by that.

Note: this wasn't tested against the other Z2 characters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 constants.cns
Fixed head.pos and mid.pos.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 supers.cns, system.cns
Mouth overlay sprites bugs during aura charge and enemy superpauses fixed.
ownpal = 0
supermovetime = 99999
pausemovetime = 99999

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 gohan.sff
Small portrait replaced.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#6 supers.cns, state 2115
For some reason the Soaring Dragon Strike (lvl 1) could send the enemy flying very high.
The problem was
ground.velocity=-1.5,-80
I just deleted the 0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#7 supers.cns, state 2215
Soaring Dragon Unleashed (lvl 2)

First hitdef:
damage = 19,2
ground.velocity=-1.5,-20
air.velocity=-1.5,-10

changed to

damage = 22,2
ground.velocity=-1.5,-2
air.velocity=-1.5,-4

Second hitdef:
damage = 22,4

changed to

damage = 27,4

Note: its damage is still very little though.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
