Yukari Tanizaki from Azumanga Daioh - Largely based off A! Taisen Shiyou
converted to MUGEN by jade_midori.

================<Change list (25/06/2018)>================

-Command for Imperial Wrath changed, turns out in source the command had a typo in the source game's movelist, it was actually D, HCF, B, F + C, which explains
why it was so impossible.
-After Images adjusted, end times adjusted.
-Burst damage changed to double damage, no defense boost is added.
-Fixed hyper background to not move from the screen if it's done.
-Imperial Wrath is a reversaldef now, not a hitoverride, it's guaranteed if she's hit.

==========================================================
