Beavis for Mugen by The_None, 27.11.2014

Once upon a time, Beavis and Butthead deviate from their usual Music Video watchings by watching a news report about a fighting tournament that seemingly anybody can join in and show off. On the report they notice someone who looks suspiciously like Michael Bolton on it. Realizing he has the opportunity to kick Bolton's ass, Beavis decides to join in the fray.
