Blitztank
From Akatsuki Blitzkampf / Blazblue Cross Tag Battle
Version 1.1
For M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and above
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Notes
==========================================================================================
-In Mugen 1.0, The Ultra Burst Meter will cause a string of Debug errors. To fix this, swap out "BurstHUD.cns" with "BurstHUD10.cns" in the Def file.

-This character was made with only single and turns mode in mind, so using this in simul mode is probably not a good idea.

-It is recommended that you set the WavChannels to 64 or higher in mugen.cfg. This will prevent sound effects from cutting each other off.

-Due to the custom fall states, Stupa's Training character will not realize that they can recover despite "recover" being turned on. To fix this, Paste this code at the bottom of Training's config file:

[State 5050, 4] ;Recover near ground
type = SelfState
triggerall = stateno = 6050
triggerall = Vel Y > 0
triggerall = Pos Y >= -20
triggerall = alive
triggerall = CanRecover
trigger1 = Command = "recovery"
trigger2 = var(16) = 1
trigger2 = var(23)>=var(22)
value = 5200 ;HITFALL_RECOVER

[State -2]; Recover in mid air
type = selfState
triggerall = stateno = 6050
triggerall = Vel Y > -1
triggerall = alive
triggerall = CanRecover
trigger1 = Command = "recovery"
trigger2 = var(16) = 1
trigger2 = var(23)>=var(22)
value = 5210 ;HITFALL_AIRRECOVER

-Downloading this character from Mugen Guild or OHMSBY's Mugen site ensures that this is the latest version.

==========================================================================================
Introduction
==========================================================================================
This Blitztank uses a custom gameplay style. Though he's not source accurate, he still plays similarly to how he does in Cross Tag while having new stuff and a couple of things that he had in Akatsuki Blitzkampf. This read me will explain how this gameplay style works. His move list can be found in the .png included in this folder.
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Default Button Layout
==========================================================================================
A, B, and C: Attack Buttons

X: Rapid Cancel

Y: Dodge

Z: Grab
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Gameplay Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dodge (Y)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a very short amount of time, you'll become invulnerable and can pass through the opponent and their projectiles. Just pressing Y will keep you stationary, pressing Y and forward at the same time will have you move forward a short distance, and pressing Y and back will have you back dash. The stationary dodge can also be done in the air. You will become vulnerable again near the end of the dodge animation, so be carful about how you time it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grab (Z)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again, pretty self explanatory. Overrides the opponent's guard, but only works if they're not in the air and not in a hit state. As long as the grab is not registered as a counter, The opponent will be able to break out of this by inputting A+B, B+C, X+Y, or Z within 14 frames after being grabbed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Grab (Z in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inversely, only works on airborne opponents and can work even when they're in a hit state. Can be used as a combo ender.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid Cancel (X When your attack has made contact with the opponent) (Costs 1000 meter) (Costs 500 meter if used during a Distortion Drive)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will immediately put you in a neutral state, this can be used to extend combos, make otherwise unsafe moves safe, or make you more unpredictable to your opponent. Holding Forward or back while inputing the command will immediately have you run or back dash respectively (Air Dash Forward/Back when in the air), Holding up will immediately make you jump, and holding down while in the air will quickly bring you back to the ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Angle Attack (Press Forward and X or Forward and B+C While guarding) (Costs 1000 meter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancels your guard animation into an invulnerable attack animation that sends the opponent flying backward. Deals damage, but doesn't kill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burst (y+z while getting hit) (Can only be used when Burst meter is full) (Doesn't work if you're being thrown or being hit by a super)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploys a non damaging blast around your character that sends you opponent flying away from you. A poorly timed burst can leave open for even more damage, so be carful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultra Burst (y+z while in a neutral state) (Exhausts Burst)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will put you in a powered up state that gives the following benefits:
 +Health and Meter will gradually recover overtime (Unless you're taking damage)
 +Damage output will be increased by 20%
 +Timer will be frozen
 +Hitting the opponent with the Ultra Burst will launch them upward and will be unable to recover from it
 +Hitting the opponent with the ultra burst will also grant 500 meter instantly
The time that the Ultra Burst state will last is proportionate to the amount of health lost prior to activating, Attempting an astral heat will immediately end the Ultra Burst state

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultra Dead Angle (y+z while Guarding) (Exhausts Burst)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will cancel your guard stun and make you invulnerable for ten frames after the super pause. This also puts you into the Ultra Burst state, but it will only last a third of the time it would if you were to Ultra Burst normally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overheat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you let the Ultra Burst timer run out, you will enter Overheat status for a set amount of time. During Overheat, your Burst Gauge will not recover and your meter will slowly drain. Landing an Exceed Accel will prevent an overheat from happening as well as grant you an additional 30% to you Burst Gauge, however you will also immediately go into Overheat if your Exceed Accel misses.

Missing your Astral Heat will also trigger an overheat.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not Over Yet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon reaching 35% health or below and not being in a hurt state, you will receive the following benefits for the rest of the round:
 +All Distortion Drives deal 20% more damage (Stacks with Ultra Burst's damage buff)
 +Immediately Gain 500 Meter
 +Slowly gain meter overtime
 +Gain a defense buff that scales up to 35% according to how much health you currently have (Less health means more defense)
Only triggers once per round


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake up Action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wake up animation can be canceled into a forward dodge or a back dash. In Blitztank's case, he can also cancel into either Entladung or Reflector.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter hit properties
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All attacks will deal bonus damage if they hit the opponent while they're attacking and in some cases, causes more hit stun and more unrecoverable time.

==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Character Specific Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflector
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A counter type reversal. If Blitztank catches a physical attack with this, he will immediately retaliate with an Entladung (Aside from being able to use Reflector again before Blitztank uses Entladung, this cannot be followed up). If Blitztank catches a projectile, he won't do anything, but the animation can be canceled into any of his attacks, a dodge, another Reflector, or even an Ultra Burst.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blitztank has armor against projectiles and standing attacks during the start up of all of his grounded normals while all the air normals have armor against projectiles and air attacks during the startup. Anstrum has armor against all attacks up until the last active frame.
