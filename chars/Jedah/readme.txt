JEDAH
v2.0 for MUGEN 2001.04.14

Hello people!  This is an update to an awesome character made by a great
creator.

He's mean, he's evil, and he's so damn cool!  Presenting Vampire Savior's
main villain, the Lord of Vampire himself, Jedah!

Updates since the previous release ---------------------------------------

- Added 4 new palettes, and fixed up some sprites.
- Advancing Guard now has a spark and sound effect.
- Rasare=Sega hits a bit better now.
- Implemented Gold and Shadow versions; overpowered characters rock! >:D
- And lots of small fixes and tweaks here and there...

What's in? ---------------------------------------------------------------

- Everything and then some.

What's not in yet? -------------------------------------------------------

- There's nothing left to implement... except maybe non-Vamp Savior stuff.

What will never be done? -------------------------------------------------

- Nothing, actually.....

Storyline ----------------------------------------------------------------

I forgot the official storyline, but what's there to know anyways?  Jedah
is the reason why there's a Vamp Savior.  He plans to take souls, destroy
the world, and start a new one in his image.  That's why he's evil >:)

Jed simply reeks of evil, from his long claws to his sharp blade-like wings.
He also fights with blades and blood; simply gruesome.  And in the end, he
takes his opponents' souls.

So far, you'll only see him in Vamp Savior; he has yet to appear in any
other game.  Poor guy.

---------------------------------------------------------------Instructions:

Set the destination unzip directory at the "chars" directory of MUGEN.
Then, specify a subdiectory called "jedah".  Even if you have a duplicate
Jedah, its naming scheme will not overwrite the other (unless the other Jed
is also in a directory called "jedah").

----------------------------------------------------------Gameplay Overview.

Jed's a bit tall, but not too tall.  He walks a bit slow, but watch out when
he takes into the air because he's a lot more mobile there.  His attacks
have pretty long reach, and they look evil to boot >:)

---------------------------------------------------Gold and Shadow Versions

These are enhanced versions of Jedah; select the Shadow version by holding
down Start and pressing the "X" button, and select the Gold version by
holding down Start and pressing the "A" button.

The Shadow version has infinite power; you can use ES moves, supers, and
any other power-consuming moves at any time and as many times as you want.
But apart from that, the Shadow version plays normally.

The Gold version, on the other hand, is very different.  In this version,
he has enhanced defence (he takes less damage), enhanced special moves (they
are always ES versions that don't use any power), and slightly enhanced
supers (they can hit much better and can even combo, but they still do the
same damage).  In short, he's a lot more powerful than his normal version
>:)

This feature was pretty much inspired by the Guilty Gear series, where
characters have alternate shadow and gold versions that enhance them with
extra abilities (like enhanced strength, overpowered attacks, and infinite
power).

---------------------------------------------------------Special Animations

Some of Jedah's moves cause special animations on other characters who have
them.  Here's a list of those animations and their anim numbers:

- Collapse (5130 (falling to knees) and 5131 (on knees and falling to
ground)): When hit by a certain attack, the character drops to the floor
from his standing position; a common animation in KoF.  But Jed himself
doesn't have this anim.
- Vertical spinning (5250 (going upwards) and 5251 (going downwards): When
hit by a certain attack, the character flies through the air spinning like
a top; a common animation in the Marvel fighting games.  No, Jed has no such
anim.
- Seppuku (7694): Ye olde Japanese art of taking a sword and stabbing your-
self with it because you're a dishonorable dog; this anim can be used to
force Jed against his will (by a spell for instance) to stab himself with
a katana.
- Bee stung (7695): The aftermath of being swarmed and stung by bees or
other such similar insects; Jed is no bee, but he does have this anim so
that other bee-like fighters can pepper him with stingers :)
- Shocked (7696): Being struck by an electric attack; Jed himself has no
electric attack, but he does have this anim so anyone with an electric
attack can zap him and see that he's made out of runes :)
- Burned (7697): Being struck by an explosive or fiery attack; nope, Jed
can't burn but he can be burnt.
- Bloated up (7780): Being inflated like a balloon until they pop; one of
Jed's attacks does exactly this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------Moves

Be wary that MUGEN uses a Sega Saturn-type of controls; X,Y,Z, A,B,C,
and that some buttons are not available for all characters.  Jed, though,
utilizes all 6.

If your button orientation is at A-Z, please change it to X-C.  X,Y,Z are
punches, and A,B,C are kicks.  It'd be weird if the kicks were at the top
row :)

---------------------------------------------------------------Combo System

In the Darkstalkers games, everyone has something called a chain combo,
the ability to link a normal punch or kick into another.  It goes like
this: LP - LK - MP - MK - HP - HK.  You can skip part of the sequence
(you can do LK - HP or LP - MK - HK), but you can't do it backwards (no
MP - LP or HK - HP - LK).  And you heard me right, all the Darkstalkers
have it (even big brutes like Victor; not even Zangief can boast that!).

This combo system also exists in the Marvel crossover games.  Apart from
the full 6 (which is known as the zig-zag), there are other variations like
weak-to-strong, stronger, and punch-to-kick.  All the Darkstalkers in there
(which would be Morrigan, Felicia, Anakaris, and BBH) use the zig-zag combo
system, being Darkstalkers and all :)

And it's no different here in MUGEN.  Jed utilizes the zig-zag, so you can
do mad combos with your normal attacks alone.  However, special and super
moves can only be done by themselves; you can't combo from a normal attack
into a special or super.

BASIC AND NORMAL MOVES ---------------------------------------------------

Just so you know:
X = LP
Y = MP
Z = HP
A = LK
B = MK
C = HK

- Dash (F,F)
Jedah takes off into the air, leaving behind a trail of blood as he goes.
Faster than simply walking normally, this is useful for getting near your
opponent quickly.

- Retreat (B,B)
Same as the Dash, but backwards.  Useful for getting away from the opponent
quickly.

- Balzo=Perdono (in the air, F,F)
Jed flies forwards.  It's an air dash, and it's also an attack as the wings
can hurt your opponent.  Told you he was very mobile in the air.

- Air Recover (in the air, PP)
Staple of MUGEN.  If you find yourself falling helplessly from the air,
use this to get your wind back and foil any juggle attempts your opponent
may be planning.  Be wary that some attacks may not allow for air recovery.

- Advancing Guard (while blocking on the ground, P,P,P,P/K,K,K,K)
Getting pressured by the opponent?  Shove him away from you!  While blocking
an attack, tap any attack button 4 times, and you'll give yourself some
breathing room from the opponent.  Good for getting away from him before an
attack of his gets through your defense.  Also deflects from behind, so you
can shove away your opponents from both sides in team battles.  You can't do
this while blocking in the air however, only on the ground.

- Moving Get-up (when down, hold B/F until you get up)
Getting knocked down sucks.  Getting trapped in a corner or in between two
opponents in team battles suck even more.  No more!  Now you can get out
of such situations.  When you find yourself down, hold F or B until you get
up.  You'll move a small distance in the direction you held down and then
get up.  As mentioned before, this is handy for getting out of those nasty
corner traps and such.

- (LP)
Jed attacks with one arm.  Typical LP attack.

- (while crouching, LP)
Same thing except in a crouching position.

- (in the air, LP)
Same thing except in an aerial position.

- (LK)
Jed attacks with his wing.  Typical LK attack.

- (while crouching, LK)
Same but crouching.

- (in the air, LK)
Same but aerial.

- (MP)
Jed thrusts his hand forward, and its claws suddenly extend outward!  Has
pretty long range.

- (while crouching, MP)
Same deal but while crouching.

- (in the air, MP)
Same deal but while in the air.

- (MK)
Jed takes a part of his wing and throws it to the ground in front of him as
the wing turns into splashing blood.  Decent ground attack.

- (while crouching, MK)
Jed stabs the ground as his wings sink into it and comes out in front of him
as a bloody blade.  Decent ground attack too.

- (in the air, MK)
A wing attack like his LK, but directed more downwards.

- (HP)
Jed's hand shoots out a bit, then two more follow, all of them leaving a
trail of blood.  Very long range, and very evil-looking too >:)

- (while crouching, HP)
Same.

- (in the air, HP)
Guess.

- (HK)
Jed's wings turn into a scythe with which he slashes with it.  The range is
big and it's also an overhead attack (must be blocked high), but it's slow.

- (while crouching, HK)
Like the crouching MK, but instead of a blade, a portal opens up and hands
lash out from it.  Range is same as crouching MK's.

- (in the air, HK)
Jed floats in the air as several small blades assault his front.  Nice close
attack.

THROWS -------------------------------------------------------------------

These are unblockable attacks that must be done close to the opponent.
They can be escaped from, though, if the opponent presses a button just as
he's grabbed.  The window of escape, however, is very small.

- Sangue=Vangelo (near opponent, hold B/F + MP/HP)
Jed grabs his opponent, holds them up, then splashes them with blood.

- Mesto=Spinta (in the air near opponent, hold B/F + MP/HP)
Jed grabs, flies up, then stabs the opponent into the ground with his wings.

SPECIAL MOVES ------------------------------------------------------------

You can perform more powerful versions of these moves, called ES (enhanced
special) versions.  Simply do the same motion, but press 2 attack buttons
instead of just one.  You need 1 level of power to do this, however.

- Dio=Sega (D,DF,F + P)
Jed takes a part of his wing and throws it out as it turns into a spinning
blade.  This blade doesn't move at all; it'll just spin there until it comes
into contact with something.  If that something is the opponent, he gets
cut >:)
You can also do this move in the air.
The Punch button pressed determines where the blade will be.
The ES version has Jed throwing out a much bigger spinning blade that covers
more area.  It can also act as a wall against most projectiles.

- Nero=Fatica (D,DB,B + P)
Jed claws the air in front of him as he goes backwards.  If the claw marks
hit the opponent, they turn into a bubble that entraps the opponent.  Then,
Jed bursts the bubble with his scythe.  It's a nice counter against a rush-
ing opponent.
For the ES version, Jed whacks the bubble somewhat before slashing it for
more damage.

- Spregio (while blocking, F,D,DF + P)
Jed decapitates himself!  Blood then splashes out from his neck to knock
away the opponent.  Then, his head regenerates.  Very sadistic-looking >:)
This move is used as a counterattack since it can only be done while block-
ing attacks.
The ES version has him splashing out more blood than usual for more damage.
Gross, ain't it? >:)

- Ira=Spinta (in the air, F,D,B + K)
Jed flies in place for a bit, then dives down to grab the opponent.  If he's
successful, he picks them up, flies up, then slams the opponent into the
ground and grinds them into it with his wings as he spins.  And during all
this time, he's laughing maniacally >:)
Pressing Punch before he dives makes him do a different attack in which his
wings turn into a giant spinning blade before he dives down.  You can play
mind games with this move.  Will you do a grab or not? >:)
For the ES version of the grab, the grinding is more forceful for more
damage, as indicated by the ton of blood coming from the opponent >:)
As for the diving blade, it hits up to 5 times instead of just once for, you
guessed it, more damage.

- San=Passare (on the ground, F,D,B + K)
Jed does a grab.  If he misses, he stumbles.  If he manages to grab an oppo-
nent, he pumps blood into them until they explode.  Very gross >:)
Unlike the other special moves, this one has no ES version.

- Rasare=Sega (while opponent is down, U + P/K)
Jed turns his wings into a giant spinning blade and jumps onto the downed
opponent to cut them.  Just because they're down doesn't mean they're safe
>:)
For the ES version, the blade hits multiple times instead of once for more
damage.

SUPER MOVES --------------------------------------------------------------

All super moves require and use up 1 level of power unless specified
otherwise.

- Prova=di=Servo (B,D,F + KK)
Jed cuts his wrist, and the blood that splashes from it crawls along the
floor.  Pressing Kick will turn this blood into a giant hand that attempts
to grab the opponent.  If successful, the hand picks them up, smashes and
grinds them into the ground, then forces them to sign a giant contract by
slamming them into it to leave their mark there.  Afterwards, the contract
turns into a soul that the Jedster takes.  It's so damn diabolical >:)
Of course, it's a bit slow, and the hand can only grab grounded opponents.

- Finale=Rosso (D,D + PP)
Jed sinks his hand into the ground, causing a portal to open from under the
opponent where hands come out and attempt to grab them.  If they do get a
hold of them, they drag the opponent into the portal as Jed follows.  They
arrive to a place submerged in blood, where Jed gives the command for the
hands to assault the helpless opponent.  After a while, he comes back out as
the opponent is shot out from the place.  Yep, Jed is very gross indeed >:)
Like the previous super, this is also slow to come out, and the hands can
only grab grounded opponents.

- Santuario (LP+LK/MP+MK/HP+HK)
Jed takes into the air, his wings flapping.  Essentially, he's in flight.
While this super is in effect, Jed can fly in any direction.  He can also
land on the ground and take off again.  He can even block in the air while
flying.  Basically, he owns the sky >:)
It doesn't last forever, though.  A timer will indicate how long the super
will remain in effect.  Once the timer expires or if you repeat the command,
the super will end.

----------------------------------------------------------------Some bugs:

- Sometimes, Gold Jedah's enhanced defence fails and he takes full damage.
  It only happens very rarely, but I still wish I knew its exact cause...
- Some moves and stuff might work strangely in Simul fights due to the fact
  that more than two characters are fighting at a time.  This is actually
  the game engine's fault, not Jedah's :)
