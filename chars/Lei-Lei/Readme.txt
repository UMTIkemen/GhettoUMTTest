=====<Move Details>=====

- Zampa is Lei-Lei's pounce attack, so it can only be done while her opponent is lying down;

- Sometimes, during Ankihou, Lei-Lei will throw a dizzying object;

- Senpuubu can be done twice in a row, while Lei-Lei is still in the air;

- Henkyouki can reflect projectiles;

- Houtengeki is an unblockable throw;

- Inputing the Chuukadan command while a bomb is already out will detonate it;

- The Chuukadan bomb can be hit around by any player. However, when it explods it can also
damage any player, Lei-Lei included. The best way to avoid the explosion is by detonating the
bomb yourself, when you're at a safe distance;

- You can mash kick buttons during the EX Jireitou to increase the number of hits;

- Tenraiha weight must be blocked high and the ground shockwave must be blocked low. The spiked
balls can only be air guarded before they bounce off the ground;

- Hold forward or backward during Recovery Slide to choose in which direction to go;

- Keep holding Start to delay the Taunt;



=====<Other Info>=====
