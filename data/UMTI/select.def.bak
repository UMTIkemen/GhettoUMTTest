[Options]
 ;Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in arcade
 ;mode. The first number is the number of matches against characters with
 ;order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively. For example, for 4,3,1
 ;you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked characters who have order=1, followed
 ;by 3 with order=2 and 1 with order=3.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders mugen limitation is lifted.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Characters can use individual maxmatches settings (see
 ;'maxmatches' parameter in [Characters] section)

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Arcade single mode.
arcade.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Arcade team modes (sans 'Ratio').
team.maxmatches = 4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Time Attack mode.
timeattack.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: Similar to arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Survival mode.
 ;Use -1 value to choose which order number should have unlimited matches.
 ;By omitting -1 survival mode will end after particular amount of matches set
 ;below (in such case you can actually "complete" the mode).
survival.maxmatches = -1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: A 'Ratio' mode allows each team to select up to 3 characters
 ;and distribute 4 "ratio levels" amongst them, affecting their life and damage
 ;(ratio 2 is the default to which other ratios are compared, percentages are
 ;adjustable in options screen).
 ;Arcade ratio matches use 'ratiomatches' configuration instead of 'maxmatches'
 ;settings. Each entry here, separated by commas, represents a single match and
 ;consists of 2 assignments, separated by colon. Assignment on the left side of
 ;colon refers to the number of characters you will face in this match (valid
 ;numbers from 1 to 3, or a random selection range, consisting of one number,
 ;followed by a dash and another number). Assignment written after colon refers
 ;to character's order param, that can be used to limit which characters should
 ;be randomly chosen for this match. For example 2-3:4 entry means a match
 ;against team of 2 or 3 characters, chosen from characters with order=4.
arcade.ratiomatches = 1-3:1, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1, 1-2:3

 ;AI ramping
 ;IKEMEN feature: AI ramping settings has been moved here from mugen.cfg
 ;You can view AI ramping output for all battles from the last chosen mode via
 ;debug/t_aiRamp.txt (useful reference also for vanilla mugen).

 ;Arcade / Time Attack single mode AI ramping
 ;For both parameters below, the first number corresponds to the number of
 ;matches won, and the second number to the AI difficulty offset. The actual
 ;difficulty is the sum of the AI difficulty level (set in the options menu) and
 ;the value of the offset at a particular match.
 ;  AIramp.start = start_match, start_diff
 ;  AIramp.end   = end_match, end_diff
 ;The difficulty offset function is a constant value of start_diff from the
 ;first match until start_match matches have been won. From then the offset
 ;value increases linearly from start_diff to end_diff. After end_diff matches
 ;have been won, the offset value is end_diff.
 ;  e_d            /----------
 ;               /
 ;  s_d _______/
 ;     ^      ^     ^        ^
 ;   1st_m   s_m   e_m     last_m
 ;For example, if you have:
 ;  AIramp.start = 2,0
 ;  AIramp.end   = 4,2
 ;For 6 matches at level 4, the difficulty will be (by match):
 ;  4,4,4,5,6,6

arcade.AIramp.start = 2, 0
arcade.AIramp.end   = 4, 2

 ;Arcade / Time Attack team modes AI ramping (sans 'Ratio')
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6

team.AIramp.start = 1, 0
team.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Arcade / Time Attack 'Ratio' mode AI ramping
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6

ratio.AIramp.start = 1, 0
ratio.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Survival Mode AI ramping
 ;For 16 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8

survival.AIramp.start = 0, -3
survival.AIramp.end   = 16, 4

[StoryMode]
 ;Story Mode arcs declaration. Assigned arcs are selectable via Story Mode
 ;submenu ('menu.itemname.storymode' parameter in screenpack DEF file)
 ;
 ;Declaring arcs consists of setting up following parameters:
 ; - name
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set to name that should be returned by GameMode trigger.
 ;   This parameter also initiates new story arc declaration, so it has to be
 ;   assigned before any other parameter used by the same arc. All arcs should
 ;   have unique names.
 ;
 ; - displayname
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set to name that should be displayed in Story Mode submenu.
 ;
 ; - path
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Path to file with lua extension (relative to game
 ;   directory), containing story mode arc coded in Lua language.
 ;   https://github.com/K4thos/Ikemen_GO/wiki/Miscellaneous-Info#arcs
 ;
 ; - unlock
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Pure Lua code, executed exactly as is, each time upon
 ;   loading main menu. If it evaluates to boolean 'true' the story arc will be
 ;   selectable from story mode submenu, or hidden on 'false'. Default: true.
 ;   https://github.com/K4thos/Ikemen_GO/wiki/Miscellaneous-Info#lua_unlock
 ;
 ;Examples:
 ; name = arc1
 ; displayname = Kung Fu Story Part I
 ; path = data/story/arc1.lua
 ; unlock = true
 ;
 ; name = arc2
 ; displayname = Kung Fu Story Part II
 ; path = data/story/arc2.lua
 ; unlock = true
 ;
 ;Declare your Story Mode arcs below.
